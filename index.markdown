## Welcome to Talent Consulting

At Talent we are strong proponents of Agile methodologies. Taking the flexible approach to delivery but ensuring the project is delivered to timescale, scope and budget...sometimes a difficult balancing act! But this is where our broad experience and coding standards come to the fore.

## Coding Standards

- ### Convention over configuration
  - Should only need to specify unconventional aspects of a system
- ### Modular Design
  - Subdivide application into smaller parts, i.e. micro-services, with defined contracts
- ### Scalable Design
 - Ensure application modules can be scaled horizontally and vertically

- ### Accessible Design
 - All users on all devices should be able to seamlessly and consistently access the service

- ### DRY Code
 - Early identification of common routines and methods for abstraction and shared use

- ### OO Open/Closed
 - Abiliy to add new functionality without changing existing code

- ### OO Composition over inheritance
 - Composite reuse that allows classes to achieve polymorphism by composition not inheritance

- ### Single Responsibility Pattern
 - Focus modules/classes on a single concern and single responsibility

- ### Inversion of Control	
 - Allow the application to control the program flow via a framework or configuration
